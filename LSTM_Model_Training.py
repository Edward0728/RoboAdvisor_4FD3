# 1. Acquire Stock Data Using API

# 3. Prepare Training Data Set

values = close_prices.values
# We are going to extract 80% of the closing prices from our acquired stock data as our training set

# Use the Scikit-Learn MinMaxScaler to normalize all our stock data ranging from 0 to 1.
# We also reshape our normalized data into a two-dimensional array.

# 5. Setup LSTM Network Architecture
# Define a Sequential model which consists of a linear stack of layers
model = keras.Sequential()

# Add a LSTM layer by giving it 100 network units.
# Set the return_sequence to true so that the output of the layer will be another sequence of the same length
model.add(layers.LSTM(100, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(x_train.shape[1], 1)))

# Add another LSTM layer with also 100 network units.
# But we set the return_sequence to false for this time to only return the last output in the output sequence.
model.add(layers.LSTM(100, return_sequences=False))

# Add a densely connected neural network layer with 25 network units
model.add(layers.Dense(25))

#At last, add a densely connected layer that specifies the output of 1 network unit
model.add(layers.Dense(1))
# Show summary
model.summary()

# 6. Train LSTM Model
# Adopt ???adam??? optimizer and set the mean square error as loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model by fitting it with the training set.
# We can try with batch_size of 1 and run the training for 3 epochs
hist = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size= 4, epochs=100, verbose = 1)

# 7. Evaluate Model with RMSE
predictions = model.predict(x_test)

# Use the inverse_transform method to denormalize the predicted stock prices.
predictions_inversed = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)
# Apply the RMSE formula to calculate the degree of discrepancy between the predicted prices and real prices (y_test)
rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(predictions_inversed - y_test)**2)

# data = stock_data.filter(['Close'])
# train = data[:training_data_len]
# validation = data[training_data_len:]
# validation['Predictions'] = predictions
# plt.figure(figsize=(16,8))
# plt.title('Model')
# plt.xlabel('Date')
# plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)')
