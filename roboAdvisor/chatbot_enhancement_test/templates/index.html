      <h1>Advantages of Robo Advisor</h1>
      <p>
        Robo-advisors are automated investment platforms that offer a hands-off
        approach to managing your investments. When you sign up for a
        robo-advisor, you generally fill out a questionnaire that asks about
        your personal and financial information. You can also choose a goal for
        your investment account and answer questions about your comfort level
        when it comes to investing risk.

          <h3>Hands-Off Management</h3>
          <p>
            When you're investing with a personal account or a retirement
            account through work, you may be responsible for watching and
            managing your asset allocation. Robo-advisors automatically
            rebalance your portfolio based on your goals and risk tolerance. You
            also may be able to update your goals or risk level, and your
            portfolio will be adjusted accordingly.

          <h3>Relatively Low Management Fees</h3>
          <p>
            Most robo-advisors charge a fee based on how much money is in your
            account. It can vary depending on the platform and the balance, but
            often ranges from about 0.25% to 0.89% per year. In comparison, a
            human financial advisor may charge 1% to 2%. The ETFs and mutual
            funds you're invested in may also charge a fee. These don't depend
            on how you buy the fund (on your own or through an advisor, for
            example), but you may want to review the robo-advisors' fund choices
            to compare which option has the lowest combined fees

          <h3>Tax-Loss Harvesting</h3>
          <p>
            Some robo-advisors offer tax-loss harvesting as a feature. When
            enabled, the robo-advisor can sell losing investments to "harvest"
            tax-deductible capital losses and then buy other investments that
            will keep your portfolio on track. The strategy could save you money
            this year and may lead to higher long-term gains.

              Robo-advisors work well for people who need at least some help
              with their investing portfolio. And those who need a lot of
              expertise will likely find robo-advisors to be valuable.

              While it's smart to be cautious when trusting others with your
              money, a robo-advisor may be just as safe as a human financial
              advisor. But investing always comes with the risk of losing money,
              and that's true whether you're investing on your own, hiring a
              financial advisor or using a robo-advisor.
